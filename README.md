# Weather Dashboard

## Description
A weather dashboard that inputs a user searched city into OpenWeather's Geocoding API which fetches the coordinates of the user searched city and inputs those coordinates into OpenWeather's 5-Day Forecast API to create an application that allows the user to see the current and five day forecast.
